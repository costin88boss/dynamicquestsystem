This is a demonstration addon.

It contains a world spawner of Quest NPCs.

These Quest NPCs, when interacting, can give you a quest to do.
The following quest types exist:
- Go to area & come back
- Bring me item (slows you down when picking item up)
- Defend me (spawns enemies around you, but such that they cannot directly see you)
